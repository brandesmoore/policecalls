**Question:** Does Crime Take a Holiday

1. Do crimes occur on holidays?
2. What holidays have the highest crime calls?
3. What crime(s) are called in on specific holidays?

(THE GROUP) Focusing on the 2013 data and certain police call descriptions, find out how often these types of calls are reported by the Metro Nashville Police Department on certain holidays. We decided to focus on the 2013 data since it was the only one that accounted for a full calendar year. The 2018 data stopped at Sept. 2018.

> *Police Call Descriptions:* 
Burglaries, Robberies, Thefts, Shootings (renamed PewPew) and a Person Screaming (Renamed Ahh)

> *Holidays:* NYE, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

(MY PART) Based on the tallied count of each police call description from 2013, I plotted the results in column charts and created the storytelling presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint.

# TAKEAWAYS

*Challenges*

(New Skill) Python was the first programming languate I'd ever learned, so making the adjustment on how to input code and troubleshoot errors was new to me.

*Rewards*

I learned a new programming language, Python, doing this project and was able to work collobaratively with others for a stellar presentation as a new Data Analyst. I had no prior knowledge of any programmming prior to this project, so I'm glad I was able to perform concatenating and plotting using Python.
